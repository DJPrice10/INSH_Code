# INSH_Code
Code to implement the INSH method for finding optimal Bayesian designs



Code to implement INSH algorithm from Price et al. (2018) Comp. Stat. & Data Anal. for the stochastic Death model, and a one-compartment, first-order absorbtion Pharmacokinetic (PK) model.

If you utilise this code and/or method, please cite our paper "An Induced Natural Selection Heuristic for Finding Optimal Bayesian Experimental Designs", by David J. Price, Nigel G. Bean, Joshua V. Ross and Jonathan Tuke, to appear in Computational Statistics & Data Analysis.



Please also note that the code is correct for the examples we have considered, however, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an issue if aspects of the code are changed to consider alternative input (i.e., other prior distributions). Care must be taken to ensure all aspects of the code are correct for alternative examples.

Please direct any questions or comments about the code to david.j.price@alumni.adelaide.edu.au.
